# HOGMMNC
This is the code of paper 'HOGMMNC: A higher order graph matching with multiple network constraints model for gene-drug regulatory modules identification'.
'do_simulated_experiment.m' is the main code with three experiments, including 'do_experiment_with_noise.m', 'do_experiment_with_correlation.m' and 'do_experiment_with_outlier.m'. In addition, 'do_HOGMMNC.m' is the code of our HOGMMNC algorithm.
